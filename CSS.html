      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
      the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML
      dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should
      be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. CSS is a
      cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
      JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and
      content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve
      content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
      specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple pages to
      share formatting, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural
      content.
